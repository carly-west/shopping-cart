# Overview

This app is a simple shopping list. You can add and remove items from the list by using the respective buttons.

The purpose of creating this app was to understand more how app development works, and how to integrate Kotlin with XML.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio, along with an emulator inside of Android Studio.

I used Kotlin to create the logic of the app, and XML to create the buttons.

# Future Work

* I want to make the list items look much nicer
* Add a button next to each element to remove or edit
* Change the way items are displayed, instead of just displaying a list
